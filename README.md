# Jobs On The Go Repository

Simply our idea is to make it easy for everyone to make their deliverables more easier. So basically starting form delivering packagies, food or helping people in delivering items or transporting them.

We are using the CIRC API to get the information about the nearest escooter. And display it to the app. With this data, we can give the users some reccomendation aboutthe means of transportation and we could also collabrorate also with the eScooter company. 

Posting simple jobs that need to be done in a day or two, finding someone who will do it. Connect. Delivered.

Connecting small job providers to fast job seekers.

## What benefit will your work bring in smart city context?

When we take about smart cities we are trying to provide everything in a smart way, to protect the enviroment and work towards less traffic. This app is mainly focus on those three pillars.
1) We are trying to make a good network for delivering items.
2) We encourage to use enviroment friendly transportstion like Bikes, Scooters, E-scooters and Public transportation.
3) All this will decrease the traffic so the people won't need to do everything by themself. so less people around ;)

## What were challenges you encountered and Lessons Learned?
1. Could not get GPS data from the web brownser because it requires an secure connection (HTTPS). Using Google map API for solving the problem.  
2. Intergration between different sw componets. Version control and work packages that were descriped clearly the requirements for solving the problem.   
3. Team work plays an important role in the result of the projects.
