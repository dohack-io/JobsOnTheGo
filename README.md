When we take about smart cities we are trying to provide everything in a smart way, to protect the enviroment and work towards less traffic. This app is mainly focus on those three pillars.
1) We are trying to make a good network for delivering small stuff.
2) We encourage to use enviroment friendly transportstion like Bikes, Scooters, E-scooters and Public transportation.
3) All this will decrease the traffic so the people won't need to do everything by themself. so less people around ;)

## What's next for your project?
//TODO: is there anything you've planned to work on after this hackathon? you've got some ideas of features to add? 

We would really like to extend the app to be not only for deliviring stuff but also for helping people in transporting stuff, or any small help they need. any kind of help or small job.

Some social jobs also would be great like if someone need help to ask for something install something or need help with some langauge tralslation. so people would be able to say what they actually need and how much they can afford for it. it also could be ofcourse for freeas a scoial contribution.
